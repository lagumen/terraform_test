# Terraform-Jenkins-Create-User-with-S3_perm
This template serves as a boilerplate for the initial testing of Terraform within a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. It facilitates the creation of essential resources for setting up an account with S3 bucket permissions as a quick example.

In my view, _automating IAM administration_ is of paramount importance. 

The myriad tasks related to account and permission management, both during the setup phase and for day-to-day operations, can be a significant drain on your valuable time. I could have used Travis CI but I find Jenkins to be a powerful CI/CD tool that excels in managing versioning for future Terraform automation manifests.  

Terraform, known for its cloud-agnostic capabilities, stands out as a versatile solution for managing and orchestrating multi-cloud infrastructure. It empowers you to manage and create infrastructure across a multitude of cloud environments, including both on-premises and cloud-based solutions. Don't get me wrong, AWS CloudFormation is a formidable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool as well, but is constrained and confined solely to the AWS ecosystem.

In this concise and straightforward project, we embark on the creation of a user account endowed with S3 bucket permissions, aiming for efficiency and agility in IAM management.
